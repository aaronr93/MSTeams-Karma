# Contributing to MSTeams Karma

I'm slowly working on making it easier for anyone to develop features without needing access to Azure. Until then, please reach out to me in any way and I'd be glad to help you setup the project for local testing. I'll need to provide you access to the test bot in Azure, as well as the storage account in Azure.

When contributing, please follow these guidelines in addition to the unspoken moral code all developers (should) follow.

- Be kind and assume positive intent.
- Be expressive in communication.
- Document everything clearly and concisely.
- Follow test-driven development.
- Ask before beginning work on a large or complex feature.
