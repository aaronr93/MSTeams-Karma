# Privacy Statement

If you have ever been given karma or had karma taken away from you, meaning the bot has printed your name in one of its messages, then your full name and unique Microsoft Teams ID are stored on a private database. This information is only used to keep track of your karma. The only person with access to this database is Aaron Rosenberger at Silverchair. If this access control changes, this file will be updated.
